# Machine Learning from the ground up

This repository is my personal exploration of **machine learning algorithms from the ground up**. The primary goal is to deepen my understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood by building them myself.

## Purpose

- **Learning by Doing**: Implementing algorithms manually to grasp the fundamental concepts of machine learning.
- **Multi-Language Implementations**: While starting with TypeScript, I plan to implement these algorithms in multiple languages for fun and to compare language features.
- **Embracing Imperfection**: I acknowledge that my implementations might not be optimal. Part of the learning journey is recognizing inefficiencies (like choosing between sigmoid and ReLU activation functions) and understanding the reasons behind better alternatives.

## Current Content

- **TypeScript Implementations**:
  - **Perceptrons**:
    - Logic Gates (AND, OR)
    - Linear Regression (Doubler)
  - **Neural Networks**:
    - XOR Problem

## Learning Philosophy

I believe that struggling through less-than-optimal solutions is a valuable part of the learning process. By implementing algorithms in their basic forms and then iterating upon them, I can better understand:

- **Why certain methods are preferred over others**.
- **How different algorithms perform in practice**.
- **The trade-offs involved in choosing one approach over another**.

## Future Plans

- **Expand Language Support**: Add implementations in other languages like Python, Rust, or others.
- **Explore Advanced Topics**: Dive into more complex algorithms and optimization techniques.
- **Document Learnings**: Keep track of insights gained during the journey.
